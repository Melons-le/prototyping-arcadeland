Arcade Starter Kit Documentation
---------------------------------

Thank you for purchasing my Arcade Starter Kit!  This is my first submission to the Unity Asset Store, and as such, your feedback is vastly appreciated.  If you have any issues, suggestions, or questions regarding this pack, please do not hesitate to contact me at dustin_bogers@hotmail.com .

The intended usage of this asset pack is to help you populate your game environment with arcade-related assets.  Whether you simply want an arcade cabinet to sit in the corner of your convenience store environment, or you want to create a full-blown arcade, this asset pack should contain what you need to get started.


What is Included
----------------

This pack includes a number of prefabs of objects found in and around arcades or arcade machines.  There is a change/token machine for players, as well as quarters and tokens in both singles and bank rolls, presented in both American and Canadian currency (Note:  Please contact me if your country's currency is not present, and you would like to see it in a future pack).  There is a diner stool for sitting on, and fatigue mats for standing, as well as a milk crate for small children who cannot reach the controls.  A garbage and recycling bin is included, as well as a selection of trash and recyclable items, such as a variety of soda cans, a water bottle, a fountain drink, crumpled paper, and a pizza box.  In addition, a number of signs, posters, and an 'A Frame' style sandwich board sign will allow you to decorate flat surfaces and floors with information and precautions.
However, the main focal point of this pack is the arcade cabinet, presented with multiple possible skins, as well as 3 themed units that come complete with 'attract mode' animations that play automatically and loop when your scene is played.


How To Use This Pack
--------------------

The prefabs included in this pack work like you would expect, as you can simply drag them into your scene and place them as you wish.  Most of the models are accompanied by LOD (Level of Detail) versions that have a lowered polycount for devs who have a polygon budget.  The higher the LOD number, the more simplified the model becomes.  Prefabs have been provided for each LOD model.  The approximate triangle count for each model is as follows:

Model			| Original 	| LOD1 		| LOD2	 	| LOD3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arcade Cabinet*		| 13918		| 4116		| 1764		| n/a
Change Machine		| 5714		| 1808		| 750		| 22
Coin			| 128		| 64		| 32		| n/a
Coin Roll		| 352		| 112		| 50		| n/a
Crumpled Paper		| 400		| 240		| n/a		| n/a
Diner Stool		| 10132		| 2074		| 750		| n/a
Fatigue Mat		| 24		| n/a		| n/a		| n/a
Fountain Drink		| 2112		| 864		| 270		| n/a
Garbage Can		| 3782		| 1626		| 852		| 406
Milk Crate		| 19352		| 13326		| 24		| n/a
Pizza Box		| 274		| n/a		| n/a		| n/a
Sandwichboard Sign	| 5360		| 1496		| 716		| n/a
Signs/Stickers		| 2 - 12	| n/a		| n/a		| n/a
Soda Can		| 2540		| 664		| 190		| n/a
Tape			| 200		| n/a		| n/a		| n/a
Water Bottle		| 5008		| 1120		| 340		| n/a

* The triangle count for the arcade cabinet can vary depending on how many buttons and joysticks are present.  This count assumes the default 2-joystick/14-button setup.


Customizing Your Arcade Cabinets
---------------------------------

Step 1 - Choose one of the four 'generic' cabinet prefabs ('blank', 'bonusround', 'fauxwood', or 'halftone'), or one of their LOD prefabs.

Step 2 - 'Blank', 'Bonus Round', and 'Halftone' styles are tintable by design.  I have provided several sample colors for each, but you can also copy any of the existing materials and tint them however you wish.  Apply the material you like to the 'main_color' mesh.

Step 3 - Under the 'main_color' mesh, there are several title marquees ('Arcade Classics', 'Bonus Round', 'Mr. Dinosaur', 'Doggo Copter', 'Space Tennis', 'Macho Nacho', 'Blocks on Blocks', 'Blood Code', 'Cheese Stands Alone', 'Geoma Tree', and 'Green Star Ace'.  Activate one and either de-activate or delete the rest.

Step 4 - The buttons and joysticks can be moved/deleted/copied to create your desired button configuration.  For example, the default setup is ideal for 1 vs 1 fighting games, but might not make as much sense for a puzzle game or 4-player beat-'em-up.  To color the joystick knob or the buttons, apply any of the materials that begin with the prefix 'shiny'.  For the 'player one' and 'player two' buttons, you'll need to use a material beginnning with the prefix 'arcade_cabinet', or the symbols on them will be lost.

Step 5 - Each 'generic' prefab has an animator that will automatically play a simple 'attract mode' animation.  The animation will cycle through 4 screens, the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' logo, the publisher logo, then the 'game over' and 'insert coin' screens.  The materials for the last three can be swapped out as follows:

Publisher - You can apply any of the following materials to the 'screen_publisher' mesh:  screen_publisher_capslock, screen_publisher_cetari, screen_publisher_cheese, screen_publisher_geomatree, screen_publisher_gsace, or screen_publisher_median.

Insert Coin - You can apply any of the following material to the 'screen_insertcoin_generic' mesh:  screen_insert_coin_reditalic, screen_insert_coin_tealretro, or screen_insert_coin_white8bit

Game Over - You can apply any of the following material to the 'screen_game_over_generic' mesh:  screen_game_over_reditalic, screen_game_over_tealretro, or screen_game_over_white8bit

It is advisable to match your 'Insert Coin' material to your 'Game Over' material.  Also, if you are planning to put multiple arcade machines in the same place, you may wish to make copies of the 'attract_mode_generic' animation controller, slightly modify the animation playback speeds, and re-apply them at random to avoid having all of your machines play their animations in synch.  Also note that each prefab comes with an animated point light (ScreenGlowLight) that illuminates in time with your animations.  If that interferes with your lighting setup, feel free to delete or modify it.

Step 6 - The 'Bonus Round' prefabs include star shaped stickers, but you can also use the prefabs under 'signs_stickers_and_posters' to decorate your custom cabinet.  If you want to make your machine 'out of order', remember to turn the animator off!

With these 6 steps, you should be able to create many possible combinations.  Feel free to get creative!
